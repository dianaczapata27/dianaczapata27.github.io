                    <p class="justificar">Matter in the Universe organizes into a cosmic web of filaments and nodes, 
                        whose mapping at high redshifts requires luminous tracers. In this work we study the large-scale 
                        structure using quasars from the 
                            <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10403370" target="_blank" style="color:#5a2d82; font-weight:bold;">

                        catalog—in its two magnitude-limited samples, 
                        \(G<20.5\) and \( G<20.0\)—as the main tracers. We implement a reproducible methodological chain 
                        that begins with the cleaning of the sample via sigma-clipping in the \((z, z_{\mathrm{error}}/z)\) plane. 
                        After this filtering, we retain \(\simeq 67.2\%\) of the original sample with \(G<20.0\) and \(\simeq 61.3\%\) 
                        of the sample with \(G<20.5\). From this selection we define the

                        catalog and construct nine
                         volume-limited samples (VLS) for each magnitude cut. From them we estimate (i) the luminosity function, 
                         (ii) the correlation function using the Landy–Szalay estimator, and (iii) a mass assignment to the dark matter 
                         halos that host the quasars. With this information we reconstruct the density field by means of the halo-based 
                         method, and extract the filamentary skeleton with DisPerSE.<br><br>

                         We analyze the impact of spatial smoothing: greater smoothing systematically increases filament lengths, as 
                         expected when the smoothing sets the effective resolution scale. We also identify anomalies in the distances 
                         between vertices due to boundary effects. We apply a geometric filter that cuts segments with separations 
                         greater than \(30\ \mathrm{Mpc}\) and generates subfilaments, thereby stabilizing the local geometry. We 
                         compute the occupation of the filaments—defined as the number of quasars for which that filament is the 
                         nearest—and discard filaments with occupation < 5 for the samples \(M_i \le -23\) and \(M_i \le -22\), and 
                         < 3 for \(M_i \le -24\).<br><br>

                         With the resulting set we characterize the filaments by hemispheres (Galactic North and South) by means of: 
                         the distribution of distances between consecutive vertices, the distribution of lengths, the occupation as a 
                         function of length, the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the lengths, and the filament density.<br><br>

                        We identified indications of hemispheric asymmetries in these metrics; therefore, a specific overdensity 
                        analysis was carried out that included: (i) radial counts of the number of filaments; (ii) 
                        an angular sweep to locate the angular position of the overdensities on the sky; (iii) the 
                        cross-correlation function to assess the consistency between the density peaks detected in quasars and in 
                        filaments; and (iv) a visual inspection of quasar clusters around those peaks together with the 
                        filamentary skeleton.<br><br>

                        Independently, all these measures show consistent signals of simultaneous overdensity in the distributions of 
                        quasars and filaments. These signals are not primarily associated with the position of the Magellanic Clouds; 
                        consequently, we posit the hypothesis of an underlying large-scale structure. The verification of this hypothesis 
                        and its relation to the observed overdensities is left for future work.<br><br>


                        Finally, the choice of quasars as tracers, the halo-based field reconstruction, and the skeleton obtained with 
                        DisPerSE, constitute a viable and reproducible route to map the cosmic web in large volumes and lay the foundations 
                        for subsequent, more refined studies of its morphology.
